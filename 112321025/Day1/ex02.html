<title>Future of Space</title>
<h1>Could robots really replace human astronauts?</h1>

<p>On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than 
any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's 
Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including 
how it affects space weather on Earth.</p>

<p>This was a landmark moment for humanity â€“ but one without any human 
directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by 
itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all.</p>

<p>Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six 
decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans. During its 10-day flyby, 
the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C.</p>
